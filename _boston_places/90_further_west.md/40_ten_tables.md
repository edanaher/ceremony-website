In Jamaica Plain (where Kelly & Evan live), a bit of a walk from the Green Street T station, or right off of the 39 bus route.  We went here after every snow storm of 2015.  When Evan is out of town, Kelly normally goes Thursday night stop here for the $15 pasta and glass of wine. More upscale local spot with a great food, cordials, wine, and beer menu.
