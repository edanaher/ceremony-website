Forest Hills Station on the T.  If you need a reason to come down to Jamaica Plain, this is a great one.  Great way to spend a few hours walking among flora from all over the world.  Some of the trees here are even older then the United States.  From here you can walk up the Emerald Necklace, a series parks designed by Olmstead, to Fenway park.
