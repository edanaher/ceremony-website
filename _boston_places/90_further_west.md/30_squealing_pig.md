A few blocks from MFA, great food at a good price, with a nice beer list.  We suggest eating here instead of at the MFA. Try the Mars Bar Toastie for dessert, if you have the room.  If for some reason you get in Thursday night, and don't mind being in a bar with college students, this place can be a fun time (and most likely where Kelly will be).
