In Jamaica Plain (where Kelly & Evan live), a bit of a walk from the Green Street T station, or right off of the 39 bus route.  The most farm to table restaurant in Jamaica Plain, if not Boston. Incredibly good and interesting vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options.  Great, but small, curated beer menu.  Evan is still mad, after over a year, that there is no longer Sunday Brunch here.
