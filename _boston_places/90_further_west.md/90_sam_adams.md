Stony Brook T Station, Orange Line. Beer.  This is also Kelly & Evan's local farmers market on Saturday mornings.  The brew tour at Sam Adams is free, but please donate the $2 they ask you to, to one of the local charities in Boston.  Afterwards you can take the drunk Trolley to Doyle's, a bar where Joe Kennedy used to hold court, and where every Democrat running for office in Massachusetts or country wide has a meet and greet at.
