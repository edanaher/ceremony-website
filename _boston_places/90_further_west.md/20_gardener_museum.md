Right next to the MFA, this is an interesting art museum.  Its claim to fame is that the greatest unsolved art heist (ever) took place here.  What makes it more interesting is that Isabella's will stipulates that none of the art may be moved from its original placement (though they can loan somethings out).  With how the heist was achieved, the result is that the frames without the paintings are still in the exact same places.  Also due to will stipulations, it's interesting to see a Raphael in a corner of a museum instead of front and center.  If you want to see Old Masters in Boston, there are many more important paintings here then in the MFA.
