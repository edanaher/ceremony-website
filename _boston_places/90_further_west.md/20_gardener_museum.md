Right next to the MFA.  This is an interesting art museum.  It's claim to fame is the greatest unsolved art heist, ever, took place here.  What makes it more interesting, is because in Isabella's will, it stipulates that none of the art may be moved from it's original placement (they can loan somethings out), and how the heist was achieved, the frames without the paintings are still in the exact same places.  Also due to will stipulations, it's interesting to see a Raphel in a corner of a museum instead of front and center.  If you want to see Old Masters in Boston, there are many more important paintings here then in the MFA.
