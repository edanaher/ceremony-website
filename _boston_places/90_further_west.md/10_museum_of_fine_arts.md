The best art museum for pre-modern American Art in the US (suck it Metropolitian!).  Come see American artists from Copley to Sargent here.  The rest of the Museum is pretty great too, and includes everything from Old Masters to Contemporary Art. It's Egyptian and Chinese/Japanese Art collections, are also very strong, if that is your thing.
