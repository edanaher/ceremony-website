Green Line: Park, Orange/Red Line: Downtown Crossing. One of Kelly's favorite wine bars (RIP Belly).  Interesting natural wine mixed with 90's hip hop, small plates, and tinned fish.  Got a lot of great press in June 2017, so it might have become too crowded for Kelly by the time you are reading this.
