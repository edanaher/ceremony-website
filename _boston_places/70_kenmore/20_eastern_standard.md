place: Eastern Standard/The Hawthorne
---
Eastern Standard was one of the first places in Boston that did upscale mixed
drinks.  The food is also pretty great here, though it can be loud.  The
Hawthorne is really just a cocktail lounge with small bites, but as long as
there isn't a game, it's pretty quiet.
