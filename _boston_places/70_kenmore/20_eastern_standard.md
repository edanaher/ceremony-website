Green Line to Kenmore. Eastern Standard was one of the first places in Boston that "did" upscale mixed
drinks.  The food is also pretty great here.  Then one drawback is it can be loud (ask for a table outside if it is).  
The Hawthorne is a really nice cocktail lounge with small bites. If there isn't a game, it's pretty quiet.
