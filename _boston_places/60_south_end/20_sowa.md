place: SoWa Market

It's become stroller city, but on the weekends, SoWa market is pretty nice, with lots of local artisans, a farmer's market, and lots of local food trucks converging on Harrison Street.  This did put the "South of Washington Street" district on the map. It kind of sucks for a lot of the older artists in the neighborhood though, which have seens their rents go through the roof.
