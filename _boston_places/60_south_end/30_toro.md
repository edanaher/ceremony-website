One of Kelly's favorite places.  No reservations. Great Spanish tapas from two of the chefs who helped start up Boston's dining scence.  (Other restaurants include Coppa, in the South End, where Kelly got some of the worst food posioning of her life, and Little Donkey, in Central Square Cambridge, which is really good.)
