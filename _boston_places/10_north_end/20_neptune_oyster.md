Yes, the North End is known for its okay Italian Food, but Neptune Oyster is
one of Kelly's favorite seafood restaurants in Boston, though It's on the very pricey
side. Lots of oysters, lot of fish, and some lobster rolls.  There are no
reservations.  If you want to eat here for lunch on Saturday or Sunday in
September at 11 am when they open, get here at 10 am for guaranteed seating.
The menu is exactly the same for lunch and dinner.
