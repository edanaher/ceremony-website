place: Durty Nelly's

Green/Orange Line: Haymarket. Closest thing to a dive bar in the Fanuiel area. Nice bartenders, interesting regulars, one of Kelly's regular haunts 
(you can always ask the bartender for dominos to play while drinking if it's 
not too busy).  Also one of the few bars in Boston that lets you bring in 
your own food.
