Green Line to Park, Bolyston, or Arlington. Want to ride a swan boat while you are in Boston? This is where you ride a swan boat in Boston (okay technically it is next door at the Public Garden). Also if the Governoris on the Common, he can still give you permission to have a duel, but only on the Common.
