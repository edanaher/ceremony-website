place: Newbury Street/The Pru(dential)/Copley Place
---
Orange Line to Back Bay, or Green Line to Arlington, Copley, or Prudential. Boston's premier shopping area, all the upscale stores with less sales tax then California or NYC.  To get your bearings on Newbury Street, the closer to the Garden/Common a store is the more expensive the store is.  Also Kelly is very unhappy that they took the waterfall out of Copley Place, the new Copley place is way too sterile.
