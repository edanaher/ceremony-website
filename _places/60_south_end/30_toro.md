One of Kelly's favorite places.  No reservations. Great Spanish tapas from two of the Chef's who helped start up Boston's dining scence (other restaurants include Coppa, in the South End, where Kelly got some of the worse food posioning of her life, and Little Donkey, in Central Square Cambridge, which is really good)
