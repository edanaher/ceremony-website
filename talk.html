            <p>Want to talk to us or others about the ceremony? You have a few options:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the <a href="https://forum.kellyandevan.party">forum</a> for public discussion or questions.
                <li>If you don't want to create an account or want to keep things private, you can contact us through any of the usual means; but <a href="email:us@kellyandevan.party">us@kellyandevan.party</a> will go to both us (as soon as Evan sets it up) and be clearly flagged as ceremony-related.
