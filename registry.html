            <p class="big">As we've been together a while, we have most of the things we need going forward.  Hence we've made 3 choices for registries:</h3>
              <h2>Charity</h2>
              <p class="big">Here are three Charities, one for Kelly, one for <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/commitment-ceremony-eff">Evan</a>, and one for <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/commitment-ceremony">Toby</a>, that we'd appreciate donations to.
                        
              <h2>Bring Something Unique</h2>
              <p class="big">As we have a lot of people coming from a lot of different places, we thought it would be interesting if people would bring a good that is unique to their current living area (please no chocolate, tea, or coffee though).</p>
                        
              <h2><a href="https://www.rei.com/GiftRegistryDetails/15283088">REI Registry</a></h2>
              <p class="big">Though we have most of the goods we need, we are lacking in the ability to go car camping, hence we have created this registry. Our registry code is <a href="https://www.rei.com/GiftRegistryDetails/15283088">GR152830883</a>.</p>
