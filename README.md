Ceremony website
================

This is the Jekyll source for the website for our ceremony.  Currently very much a work in progress.

Development
-----------

Install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/): `gem install jekyll` (or, if you're using nix, `nix-env -p jekyll`; that avoid all the standard gem and ruby versioning issues), and `jekyll serve` to run it on localhost:4000.

Production
----------
Hopefully there'll be a github hook for that.  For now, I'll just do it manually.


License

This is based off of the CC-BY licensed [Linear theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/linear/), and is thus itself under the CC-BY license.  The first commit in the git history is the source theme; all further commits are custom for this site.
