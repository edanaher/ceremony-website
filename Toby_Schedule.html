							<h2>Schedule for the weekend</h2>

                        <h2>Friday:</h2>
                        <h3>Play with Toby on the Emerald Necklace.</h3>
						<h4>Location: Olmstead Park and Jamaica Pond Time: ALL DAY</h4>
						<p>Come throw a ball, let me FRAP (Frantic Random Acts of Play) in either Olmstead Park or Jamaica Pond.  If you really love me, you'll bring human food.  Also I should only play with two other dogs without toys or food around FYI.  I don't care what the humans have planned you should do this instead, or else I'll be bored.</p>

						<h2>Saturday:</h2>
