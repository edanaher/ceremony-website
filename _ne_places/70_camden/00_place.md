Mid Coast is the area between Brunswick, ME and Mount Desert Island, on Route 1.  It is a beautiful area, with many small towns.  Also it is a great place to get Lobster.  There are many places you can eat Lobster in Mid Coast while looking out and seeing the Lobster Boats come in.  We will mostly focus on Rockland and Camden, as we spend a lot of time between the two.  If you want information on Boothbay Harbor, Kelly can get you in touch with her parents, who have spent more time there (do not ask Kelly's father where to bowl in Boothbay though, it's a sore subject for him). 
We suggest staying in Camden at the Windward House, as well always have a beautiful time there. The hosts at this Inn cater to all food allergies/preferences. We particularly like Long Grain in Camden and Sushi Suzuki's in Rockland.  Cafe Miranda, in Rockland, also has an eceletic menu and is very child friendly.  The art museum in Rockland, Fansworth, focus's on American Art from Maine, and has an extensive collection of art by the Wyeth Family.  On the way up/down 1 there is always a back up in Wiscasset due to people trying to get to Red's Eats, it is worth the stop, but the line is always crazy long.
