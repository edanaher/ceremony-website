Mid Coast is the area between Brunswick, ME and Mount Desert Island, on Route 1.  It is a beautiful area, with many small towns.  Also it is a great place to get Lobster.  There are many places you can eat Lobster in Mid Coast while looking out and seeing the Lobster Boats come in.  We will mostly focus on Rockland and Camden, as we spend a lot of time between the two.  If you want information on Boothbay Harbor, Kelly can get you in touch with her parents, who have spent more time there (do not ask Kelly's father where to bowl in Boothbay though, it's a sore subject for him).
