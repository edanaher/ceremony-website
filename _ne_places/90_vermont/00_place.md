Kelly thinks of Vermont as off of route 89.  There are a lot of great places in Southern Vermont, but we really haven't been there.  We will focus on White River Junction to Burlington in this section.  Kelly also recommends taking an extra 2-3 days and going up to the Adirondacks, as she use to spend summers in Lake Placid (if you are looking to do this, please don't hesitate emailing Kelly).
