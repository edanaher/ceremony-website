If you would like to take a day trip, I would sugget Portsmouth, NH.  It's a nice town, with some cool shops and restaurants.  You will need a car to get here, and get to a few of the recommended places, as the Amtrak Downeaster makes a stop in Dover, NH (near UNH), and not in Portsmouth.  But parking is cheap and plentiful here, and they have a Row 34 you might be able to get into if you don't have a reservation.
