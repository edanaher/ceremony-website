Mount Desert Island, is spectacular, which is why one of the Rockerfellers advocated and donated land to the federal government to create Acadia National Park (and then spent a lot of money creating carriage roads which one can now bike or cross country ski on).  The biggest town on the island in Bar Harbor, which has lots of cute shops and dining options.  There are a few more towns sprinkled across the island, such as Northeast Harbor, Southwest Harbor, and Kelly's favorite, Barnard.  You will need a car to get to/from Bar Harbor, but to get around Acadia National Park there are free shuttles one can use, many starting in Bar Harbor.
