Nantucket is one of the two famous islands off the cape, and the one the Clintons and Obamas do not vacation on.  We normally spend at least a weekend here (there is a large wine festival Kelly volunteers for).  We stay at the Brass Lantern Inn (dog friendly).  Kelly loves Oran Mor for upscale food and drink (pretty much everything on the island is upscale), Brotherhood of Thieves for a good beer list & a burger, Cru for seafood, and Cisco Brewers is fun to get a beer and play games at.  The island is very dog friendly, and many restaurants having a dog friendly outdoor patio.
