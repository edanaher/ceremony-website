By the time you see this, Kelly & Toby will have, hopefully finished their New Hampshire 48 (hiking the 48 peaks in New Hampshire over 4000 feet).  The Whites are home to the place that used to have the worst weather in the world, Mount Washington (if hiking this mountain in September, be very careful, as it can snow).  At the base of Mount Washington, is a very famous Hotel, the Mount Washington Hotel, in a town called Bretton Woods.  You too can go have a seat at the table, where modern day montetary policy, as well as the IMF was formed.  As we spend many weekend up here year round, we know a lot of the places to go to in the area.
