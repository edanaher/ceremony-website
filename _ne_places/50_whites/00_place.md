By the time you see this, Kelly & Toby will have, hopefully finished their New Hampshire 48 (hiking the 48 peaks in New Hampshire over 4000 feet).  The Whites are home to the place that used to have the worst weather in the world, Mount Washington (if hiking this mountain in September, be very careful, as it can snow).  At the base of Mount Washington, is a very famous Hotel, the Mount Washington Hotel, in a town called Bretton Woods.  You too can go have a seat at the table, where modern day montetary policy, as well as the IMF was formed.  As we spend many weekend up here year round, we know a lot of the places to go to in the area.
For hotels on the cheap we suggest Swiss Chalet Inn on the East Side, Notch Hostel on the West Side, and Cottage Place on Squam Lake on the South Side (all are dog friendly).  For food & beer we suggest Woodstock Inn on the West Side (there are also rooms here, but they are expensive). We've also heard Common Man in Lincoln is also good.  On the east side we normally end up at Flatbread Pizza Company, though we've heard Tuckerman Brewery is suppose to be pretty good too.
