            <p>We apologize that these took so long.  Boston is expensive to stay in this time of year, and we're sorry about that. If you want to find other guests to split the cost of a room, you can also use the forum.  Also, if there are enough people staying at another hotel, we will route the bus there on Saturday.</p>
                        <h2>Expensive Hotel</h2>
                        <h3><a href="https://bostonparkplaza.reztrip.com/ext/promoRate?property=100&mode=b&pm=true&sr=337235&vr=3&accessCode=DUND">Boston Park Plaza </a></h3>
