							<h2>Schedule for the weekend</h2>
						</header>
            <p>There's going to be a bunch of stuff happening.  Here it is (Mostly in English...):</p>
                        <h2>Friday:</h2>
                        <h3>Laser Tag</h3>
                        <h4>Location: TBD; Time 12 pm - 3 pm</h4>
                        <p>We love laser tag, and to try to take our mind off of everything happening the next day, we are organizing Laser Tag on Friday.  As all laser tag places are out of the main city of Boston, please email us if you want to come to this, so we can figure out transportation.</p>
                        <h3>Welcome Reception for Out of Town Guests</h3>
                        <h4>Location: TBD; Time: 6 pm - 9 pm</h4>
                        <h4>Suggested Dress: Cocktail </h4>
                        <p>Since we know the hotels are expensive, we will have a dinner for guests staying in a hotel Friday Night.  We want to make sure you can afford to be well fed before the <strike>sacrifice</strike> ceremony on Saturday.  If you are staying with a friend on Friday night, we suggest you take them out to dinner, as they have saved you a lot of money.</p>
                        <h3>Beer Reception</h3>
                        <h4>Location: Gingerman; Time: 9 pm - Midnight</h4>
                        <p>Sadly, Sunset Grille & Tap, the original venue, has closed. Though replacement has been found! Kelly has the lower floor & safe rented out for the night. There will be shared bites out for everyone, but you will have to pay for alcohol. Sadly Evan will not be here, as for his last night as a non-committed man, all he wants to do is to go to bed at 9:30.</p>
                        
						<h2>Saturday:</h2>
						<h3>Trillium Brewery, 110 Shawmut Rd, Canton MA</h3>
            <h4>Location: Trillium Brewery in Canton; Time: Bus Leaves Bunker Hill at 1 pm<s>, leaves Park Plaza at 1:30</s> (due to only a few people at the Park Plaza, we ask you to just meet in the lobby at 1:15 to book an Uber, which we will reimburse you for), then we'll have cars to shuttle you from the brewery to the venue around 4:15.</h4>
					    <p>For people who would like to taste one of the better local breweries in the Boston area, which happens to be close to the ceremony site.  As they do not have private events, it will just be first come first serve at the bar.  We will have a thread in our forum where you can RSVP to this event.</p>
					    <h3>Ceremony/Sacrifice</h3>
					    <h4>Location: <a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/bradley-estate-functions/"> Bradley Estate</a> Canton, MA Time: Bus will leave at 4:00 pm from the Bunker Hill hotel, ceremony will start at 5:00 pm (guests arrive starting at 4:30 pm)</h4>
					    <h4>Suggested Dressed: Non-Gendered Formal (dress kilts are okay)</h4>
					    <p>Come join Toby, Kelly, and Evan as they commit themselves to each other for the foreseeable future.  Drinks will be served before and after (drinking during the ceremony is <strike>only from personal flasks</strike> discouraged).  We promise it will be quick and mostly harmless (at least there will be no readings).
					    <h3>Cocktail Hour</h3>
					    <h4>Location: <a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/bradley-estate-functions/"> Bradley Estate </a> Canton, MA Time: As soon as the commitment ceremony is finished</h4>
					    <p>Live music, board games, and puzzles will be awaiting you along with light food and lots of drink.  This is so that we can get all the requisite pictures done while everyone is somewhat sober (we will make sure you know what time you are needed for photos/sacrificial duties).</p>
					    <h3>Dinner/Reception</h3>
					    <h4>Location: <a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/bradley-estate-functions/"> Bradley Estate </a> Canton, MA Time: As soon as the pictures are finished - 10 pm</h4>
					    <p>There will be a three course dinner with at least 1 wine pairing per course, chosen by Kelly.  We will re-live some of our favorite cutesy and embarassing moments through the different wines. There will then be speeches (remember anyone who makes a speech will need to take a tequila shot for every minute of that speech, there will be a sign up list on the forum) and a real Champagne toast. Afterwards there will be music & dancing.</p>  
					    <p>We will also have two buses going back to the hotel blocks: one at 9 pm, and one around 10:30 pm.  Even if you are local we'd love it if you could park your car in Boston at one of the Hotels (we will pay for it), and take one of the buses.  We want to make sure people have time to sober up before driving, as we will not be happy if anyone gets a DUI or in an accident due to drinking & driving</p>
