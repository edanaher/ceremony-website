							<h2>Schedule for the weekend</h2>
						</header>
            <p>There's going to be a bunch of stuff happening.  Here it is (In Pseudo Latin):</p>
                        <h2>Friday:</h2>
                        <h3>Welcome Reception for Out of Town Guests</h3>
                        <h4>Location: TBD; Time: 6 pm - 9 pm</h4>
                        <p>This will be a dinner for guests arriving Friday from out of town.  We want to make sure you are well feed
                        before the sacrifice on Saturday.</p>
                        <h3>Beer Reception</h3>
                        <h4>Location: Sunset Tap & Grille; Time: 9:30 pm - 1 am</h4>
                        <p>The food sucks, but 100+ Drafts on Tap, plus lots of mead (word to the wise don't have more then 2 Dogfish 120 Minute IPAs in a night).  Evan wants to go to sleep by 9:30 pm (what he can't do once we are committed, unless there is hiking the next day), so Kelly will be hosting everyone who wants to stay up late here.  It is easily T accessible, plus we have whatever ride-share option pisses you off the least in Boston.  Also it is Sunset Tap & Grille, not Sunset Cantina (which will be inidated with Boston University Students who want small lousy Margaritas).</p>

						<h2>Saturday:</h2>
						<h3>Trillium Brewery</h3>
						<h4>Location: Trillium Brewery in Canton; Time: Bus Leaves at 1 pm, will then head straight to the ceremony</h4>
					    <p>For people who would like to taste one of the better local breweries in the Boston area, that is also close to the ceremony site.  Trillium will not confirm this till some time next year.  If we are not able to do this, there is a Trillium beer garden in Downtown Boston on the Roseway this year, and hopefully it will also be open next year.  We will have a thread in our forum, where you can RSVP to this event.</p>
					    <h3>Ceremony/Sacrifice</h3>
					    <h4>Location: <a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/bradley-estate-functions/"> Bradley Estate</a> Canton, MA Time: Bus will leave at 3:30 pm from one of the hotel blocks, ceremony will start at 4:30 pm</h4>
					    <p>Come join Toby, Kelly, and Evan, as they commit themselves to each other for the foreseeable future.  Drinks will be served before hand, and afterwards (bring a flask for during the ceremony if you want to drink then).  We promise it will be quick and mostly harmless (at least there will be no readings).
					    <h3>Cocktail Hour</h3>
					    <h4>Location: <a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/bradley-estate-functions/"> Bradley Estate </a> Canton, MA Time: As soon as the commitment ceremony is finished</h4>
					    <p>Some live music, board games, and puzzles will be awaiting you along with some light food, and lots of drink.  This is so that we can get all the requisite pictures done while everyone is somewhat sober (we will make sure you know what time you are needed for photos/sacrificial duties).</p>
					    <h3>Dinner/Reception</h3>
					    <h4>Location: <a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/bradley-estate-functions/"> Bradley Estate </a> Canton, MA Time: As soon as the pictures are finished - 10 pm</h4>
					    <p>There will be a three course dinner with at least 1 wine pairing per course, chosen by Kelly.  We will re-live some of our favorite cutesy and embarassing moments through the different wines. There will then be speeches (remember anyone who makes a speech will need to take a tequila shot for every minute of that speech, there will be a sign up list on the forum) and a real Champagne toast. Afterwards there will be music & dancing.</p>  
					    <p>We will also have two buses going back to the hotel blocks one at 8 pm, and one around 10 pm.  Even if you are local we'd love it if you could park your car in Boston at one of the Hotels (we will pay for it), and take one of the buses.  We want to make sure people have time to sober up before driving, as we will not be happy if anyone gets a DUI or in an accident due to drinking & driving</p>
